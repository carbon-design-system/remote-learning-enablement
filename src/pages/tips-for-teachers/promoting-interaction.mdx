## Staying connected, learning together

<PageDescription>

Social interactions play a critical role in classroom learning by helping students feel engaged and connected to their teachers and their peers. Most students are accustomed to learning in face-to-face environments which naturally promote social interaction among learners. When transitioning to an online environment, we recommend leveraging rich media like video and instant messaging to re-create the social learning experience despite the distance between you and your students.

## Video classes

For video classes, ensure everyone is on camera; microphones are on, but muted.

- Start your video class by first verifying that the students can see and hear you.
- Video helps simulate real-life social interactions by enabling educators and learners to read facial cues. 
- Being on videos helps keep students accountable, and prevents students from multitasking.
- To avoid distractions, it is a best practice that everyone but the current speaker stay on mute
- Students who cannot use video due to broadband issues will need to dial into class via phone. In order to ensure high quality audio, we recommend using a headset with a built in microphone.  
- If possible, record the session so that absent students can watch it later.

## Balance

Create a balance of work and play. 

- Online environments can limit the ability for social connections between classes and can create an "all work and no play" mentality. Pose a fun question to the group to get them talking and/or encourage people to join early to briefly socialize before class begins.
- Host fun ice-breaker activities in the beginning of class to get students engaged. 
- If it is a long class session, build in time for periodic stretch breaks (or dance breaks) to re-energize students. 

## Promote participation

Use a variety of methods to encourage participation throughout class. 

- Students can use the chat box to ask questions, make comments, and provide feedback throughout class. The chat box allows students to actively contribute to the discussion without interrupting one another. It can be helpful to appoint someone to monitor the chat activity and interrupt teacher when appropriate.
- Some video conferencing platforms have a "raise hand" feature that can be used to ask questions during class. Establish a standard means for students to "raise their hand", communicate agreement/understanding, disagreement/confusion, or stepping away.
- In-app polling and quizzing features can also be used to encourage group participation and solicit feedback on a current discussion (i.e., "Did you understand the concept we just talked about?")
- Calling on random students to share thoughts or answer questions will encourage them to pay attention throughout class. 

## Additional avenues of communication

Use an instant messaging platform to encourage engagement outside of class.

- Instant messaging platforms enable students to communicate with the instructor and their peers outside of class.
- Students can ask questions in the channel as well as interact socially. 
- Instant messaging platforms also enable students to contact their teachers directly if needed.
- Consider pairing older students with younger ones to provide tutoring and support.
