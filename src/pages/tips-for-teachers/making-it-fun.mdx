## Fun ideas for learning and connecting

<PageDescription>

We're all social creatures, relying on the connections to others for learning, development, and wellbeing — particularly in times of stress. With social distancing, our children's opportunities to engage and have fun have changed dramatically. By using digital tools, teachers and administrators can create new opportunities for togetherness and connection while also adding a fun element to learning. 

At IBM, we leverage our technology to continuously engage and support employees, ensuring they are developing important connections with one another to foster collaboration, innovation, learning, development, and a sense of community. We've considered our own engagement programs in the context of students in a distance learning environment. Following are ideas to make learning in this unusual environment fun and socially-connected.

## Gamification

Grades may not be an option in the remote learning environment, so teachers will be trying to motivate their students to keep up with their work without the rewards (or penalties) of grades. Gamification can provide supplemental extrinsic motivation to students in a positive and fun way.

There are free online tools that you can use to make personalized digital badges. Teachers can send simple image files via email to kids and announce via group chats or message boards who's won the cards. Kids can print their cards at home and collect them, or take a photo of the cards they're collecting and make a giant poster on their bedroom wall. 

Badges can be used to:

Reward behaviors to encourage connectedness and progress

- Collaboration badge
- Helping Others badge
- Wellness badge
- Kindness badge
- Reaching Out badge

Reward accomplishments to keep students motivated over time

- By day or week
- By topic area
- For a job well done
- When the entire class completes something
- Mastering levels in online learning games

## Social connectedness

**Principal's weekly message:** Develop a brief (5 minute) video message to kids and parents from the principal to recognize the community's efforts in coming together, address concerns and questions, and motivate for the next week. Consider recognizing individuals or classes for their accomplishments.

**Wellness challenges:** Encourage students to get 60 minutes of physical activity everyday and have them track their activity (their choice!) as an online assignment. Consider making it a challenge and giving rewards for achievements like trying something new, being the most consistent, etc. There are free online resources for meditation for children, yoga, and physical education.

**Virtual lunch table:** Randomly assign small groups of kids to get together via video at lunchtime once per week. Give them conversation starters to break the ice and make it fun.

**Guest speaker:** Invite a guest speaker to deliver a motivational, educational, or fun message over streaming or recorded video to the classroom or school. 

**Creative Sharing:** Have students journal, blog, or create art to help them express themselves. Encourage them to share, if they're comfortable.

**100 Minutes of Making:** Students choose one creative project and do it for 20 minutes per day to share on Friday or the following Monday with the class. For example, drawing cartoons, building with Legos, origami.

**Students Interview Others:** For a history or social studies topic, have students virtually interview a grandparent, parent, or neighbor and report on what they discovered. This encourages research and social connectedness across the community. Students can create reports via presentation slides, podcasts, video.

**Study Buddies:** Some students will naturally have a friend who they pair up with to study, but others might not. Consider randomizing your students and matching them up into pairs or triads to encourage them to connect via phone or video at times that work for them. This doubles as a helpful learning tool and another opportunity for social connection.

## Extra Curricular

**School "Paper":** Through collaboration and teamwork, a group of students can develop a blog or content a format of their choice that keeps the school connected and informed. This can be a great place to include recognition and rewards.

**Music:** In many places the weather is getting nicer. Encourage your music students to practice on their front porch, front stoop, in the driveway, or on a balcony — at a safe social distance — to brighten the days of others, soak in some sunshine and fresh air, and get their practice time in.

**Drama**

- Shared monologues: Have students write their own monologues, get feedback from the class, and then record themselves acting out the monologues. Share the videos in your digital classroom environment.
- Live play reading: Assign roles from a play to individuals and get everyone on video at the same time to do a live reading together.

**Art**

- Art Show: Assign art projects that students can do with materials in their homes or yards. Have students snap a photo of their project and host an art show in your online classroom or Instagram, inviting guardians to join at a specific time and add comments.
- Mosaic: Have each child create a piece of art at a specific size using simple materials. The mosaic can be assembled digitally while everyone is still learning at a distance. When the entire school comes back together, the art pieces will be put together to create a mosaic in a public space to demonstrate the strength and collaboration of the community.

Argument and Debate: Select a topic and assign positions to groups. Have the groups collaborate together to write the argument and submit to the digital classroom environment, where other classmates can vote on the winning submission.

Volunteer Tutoring: Consider whether there are high school students in your district who can remote-tutor younger students, particularly when their parents or guardians are trying to work from home themselves.
