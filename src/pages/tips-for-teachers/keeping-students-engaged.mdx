Working remotely with students can be challenging, but with some patience and creativity, you can recreate many of the experiences you and your students are accustomed to in your classrooms by using video and audio conferencing technology. At IBM, we have developed a number of strategies to help us remain productive and feel connected when working remotely, whether it's helping everyone stay on task, encouraging interactivity (particularly among our quieter colleagues), making work fun and engaging, or elegantly dealing with technology issues/limitations when they arise.
