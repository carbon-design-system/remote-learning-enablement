<PageDescription>

As a teacher, your presence, whether in a live video conference or just audio, will go a long way in providing your students with the reassurance and stability they need as they experience an unfamiliar level of social isolation and uncertainty.

## Give students a sense of control

  </Column>
  <Column colMd={6} colLg={8}>

Actively give your students a sense of control by allowing them some choice in selecting assignments, flexibility in submitting their work and brainstorming class activities.

Remember that learning often takes a bit longer in an online environment. Consider moving beyond traditional classroom assignments and allow your students to help provide direction.

## Get up and move

  </Column>
  <Column colMd={6} colLg={8}>

Engage students by getting them out of their chairs and get them involved in developing an active, "hands-on" learning environment for your class. Create assignments that involve going outside when safe and appropriate, or getting up and moving around their home environment.

## Stay connected

  </Column>
  <Column colMd={6} colLg={8}>

Stay connected with your students on other social platforms or by instant messaging. It's ideal if you have a communication stream that is always online and always available, so that students can interact with you and their classmates in a live (but monitored) environment. Centralize all their learning materials to make it easy for anyone to talk, watch videos or engage in learning activities from one stable location.
