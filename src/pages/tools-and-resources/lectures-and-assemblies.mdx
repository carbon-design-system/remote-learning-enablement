Businesses like IBM use tools to stream live video forannouncements to employees around the globe and to stream on-demand educational videos to employees. 

Unlike [video conferences](/tools-and-resources/classroom-and-parent-conferences), streaming video broadcasts in only one direction.The audience can view the broadcast, but the broadcaster cannot view the audience.

For teachers and students, these tools are helpful when making announcements to a large number of students orpresenting a class lecture.

## When to use live broadcast

A live broadcast may be the closest to simulating a lecture experience for students.

#### Live broadcasts:

- Require the student be available at a specific time,unless the lecture is recorded and available for later viewing
- May promote a sense of community for students, knowing that they are together with the classmates virtually
- Allows for real-time questions and answers when paired with messaging technology. However,we recommend [video conferencing](/tools-and-resources/classroom-and-parent-conferences) to support interactive classroom.

## When to use on-demand broadcast

Post a video and students can view when it's convenient for them.

Let's face it, students are already very familiar with on-demand video, so it is an attractive solution for remote learning. Post a video, and allow students to watch when it's convenient for them.

#### On-demand broadcasts:
- Allow the teacher to record a lecture over time, taking multiple takes if necessary
- Convenient for students, especially if they must share a device or computer and are unable to view a broadcast at a specific time
- Allow the student to pause and replay sections they missed or did not understand
- May not promote community as much as live broadcasts orvideo conferencing
- Do not allow for real-time questions and answers

### Useful tips

- During live broadcasts, monitor the chat feature or another messaging tool
- Encourage students to subscribe to channels so they don't miss new videos
- Create topic or classroom-based playlists to group related videos
