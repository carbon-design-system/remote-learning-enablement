## Streaming Lectures & Assemblies

<PageDescription>

There has been an exponential increase in streaming video during the past two decades. What used to be low quality and prone to "buffering" delays, is now high definition and more accessible than ever.

Unlike [video conferences](/tools-and-resources/classroom-and-parent-conferences), streaming video broadcasts in only one direction (like television). The audience can see the broadcast, but the broadcaster can not see the audience.

At IBM, we use [IBM Watson Media](https://www.ibm.com/watson/media) to live stream meetings with hundreds, or sometimes thousands, of participants. We also use Watson Media and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/IBM) to provide videos for IBMers and our clients to watch on-demand.

These tools can also benefit teachers and students moving from in-class to remote-learning environments - for example, when you want to make announcements to a large number of students or present a class lecture.

### When to use live broadcast

A live broadcast may be the closest to simulating a lecture experience for students. The entire class watch at the same time, and when paired with messaging technology, students can post their questions in real-time and receive an answer.

### Live broadcasts:

- Are live, just like a real lecture, so any mistakes or technical issues affect the broadcast, just like on a news program or Saturday Night Live.
- Require the student be available at a specific time, unless the lecture is recorded and available for later viewing.
- May promote a sense of community for students, knowing that they are together with the classmates virtually.
- Allows for real-time questions and answers when paired with messaging technology, but we recommend [video conferencing](/tools-and-resources/classroom-and-parent-conferences) to support interactive classrooms.

At IBM we use [IBM Watson Media](https://www.ibm.com/watson/media) to stream live video to employees around the globe.

### When to use on-demad broadcast

Let's face it, students are already very familiar with on-demand video, so it is an attractive solution for remote learning. Post a video, and allow students to watch when it's convenient for them.

### On-demand broadcasts:

- Allow the teacher to record a lecture over time, taking multiple takes if necessary.
- Convenient for the student, especially if they must share a device or computer with the family and are unable to view a broadcast at a specific time.
- Allow the student to pause and replay sections they missed or did not understand.
- May not promote community as much as live broadcasts or [video conferencing](/tools-and-resources/classroom-and-parent-conferences).
- Do not allow for real-time questions and answers.

At IBM we use [IBM Watson Media](https://www.ibm.com/watson/media) and YouTube to make on-demand video available to employees and our clients.

### Tips and Tricks

- During live broadcasts, monitor embedded chat or pair with messaging solution
- Encourage students to subscribe to channels so they don't miss new videos
- Create topic or classroom-based playlists to group related videos
