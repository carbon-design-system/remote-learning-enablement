## Classroom and parent conferences

  </Column>
  <Column colMd={6} colLg={8}>

While you won't be able to meet with your students in your normal classroom environment, there are some great alternatives available.

At IBM, we run thousands of video conferences every day using [Cisco Webex Meetings](https://www.webex.com/webexremoteedu.html), allowing us to meet "face-to-face" from across the globe.

## Lectures and assemblies

  </Column>
  <Column colMd={6} colLg={8}>

When you want to make announcements to a large number of students or present a class lecture with limited student interaction, there are some great options for that, too!

At IBM, we use IBM Watson Media to live stream meetings with hundreds, or sometimes thousands, of participants. We also use Watson Media and YouTube to provide videos for IBMers and our clients to watch on-demand.

## Messaging with students

  </Column>
  <Column colMd={6} colLg={8}>

Over the last few years, more and more businesses have begun to compliment existing communications channels, such as email, with messaging platforms that better support topic-based, real-time group messaging collaboration.

At IBM, our teams rapidly communicate throughout the day via tools like [Slack](https://slack.com/pricing/free) and [Webex Teams](https://www.webex.com/pricing/index.html). These tools can also greatly benefit teachers and students moving from in-class to remote-learning environments.
