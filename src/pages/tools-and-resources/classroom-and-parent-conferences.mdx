### How video conferencing can help your virtual classroom

Video conferencing tools like [Cisco Webex Meetings](https://www.webex.com/webexremoteedu.html) can help your remote classroom connect and collaborate:

- Keep your student connected and engaged during this period of social distancing
- Continue to have class time to keep a level structure and consistency
- Screen share your presentations
- Record your class sessions and make them available for students to review later
- Meet with students who need additional, one-on-onesupport, or in small groups

### Useful tips

Video conferencing tools like [Cisco Webex Meetings](https://www.webex.com/webexremoteedu.html) can help your remote classroom connect and collaborate:

 - Join your classroom video conference fiveminutes earlyand tell students they should join a few minutes early as well.
 - Provide information on videoconferencing etiquette to students before the first class, including the use of the mute feature, avoiding excess noise, the best position for their cameras, etc.
 - Make sure drapes and curtainsare closed if there are any windows in the room, as daylight can interfere with camera performance.
 - If you are having trouble with choppy video or audio on Webex, turning your video off may help. If necessary, you and your class can always dial into the conference over the phone.
 - Familiarize yourself with the various layouts available. You may find that the galleryview is best to see your entire class at one time.
