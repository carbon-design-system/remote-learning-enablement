## Video Conferencing

While you won't be able to meet with your students in your normal classroom environment, the state of video conference technology and ease-of-use has rapidly evolved over the last few years, making virtual meetings instant, seamless, and incredibly productive.

At IBM, we run thousands of video conferences every day using Cisco Webex Meetings, allowing us to meet "face-to-face" from across the globe.

> Before, when I was confined to one room all day (except for those quick escapes), I never dreamed that teaching remote would be possible. Now, I know and believe anything is possible with Webex.

### How can Video Conferencing Help?

Video conferencing tools like Cisco Webex Meetings can help your remote classroom in many ways, similar to how they help IBMers, across the U.S. and across the globe, connect and collaborate on our work. For example:

- Meet "face-to-face" with students or parents instantly, anytime
- Keep your student connected and engaged, during this period of social distancing
- Continue to hold class time to keep a level structure and consistency
- Screen share your presentations, allowing all students a seat at the front of the class
- Record your class sessions and make them available for students to review later
- Meet, 1-on-1 or in small groups, with students who need extra support

### Tips and Tricks

- Join the video conference 5 minutes early and ask students to do the same.
- Provide information on videoconferencing etiquette to students at the start of the first class.
- Let students know if you expect them to join on mute, how you would like to interact with them during the class (e.g., let them know if there is a specific time for Q&A or if questions may be asked throughout), to avoid making noise when they are unmuted, and the best position for their cameras.
- Avoid 'back-lighting' as it will be difficult for students to see your face clearly. Make sure drapes or blinds are closed if there are any windows in the room, as daylight can interfere with camera performance.
- If you are having trouble with choppy video or audio, turning your video off may help. If necessary, you and your class can always dial into the conference over the phone.
- Familiarize yourself with the various layouts available. You may find that the grid view is best to see your entire class at one time.

### Cisco Webex Meetings

Cisco Webex Meetings is available for free for classrooms of up to 100 participants and Cisco provides some great resources to support teachers, students, and parents as they transition to remove learning.
