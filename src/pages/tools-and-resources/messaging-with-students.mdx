## How messaging platforms can help your classroom

Modern messaging platforms, like [Slack](https://slack.com/pricing/free) and [Cisco Webex Teams](https://www.webex.com/pricing/index.html), can help remote classrooms—similar to how they support remote and globally distributed team sat IBM. 

Messaging platforms enable students and teachers to:

- Chat, share information, and answer questions with theentire class, small groups, or individually
- Share files and resources with theclass
- Hold multiple, topic-based conversations within a single class
- Post questions or polls to quickly assess current knowledge or collect feedback
- Providegreater alignment with the way thatstudents converse digitally than with email
- Use emoji reactions for quick responsesand engagement


These tools integrate with other collaboration solutions (e.g., [video conferencing](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/pmc-distance-learning-enablemet/tools-and-resources/classroom-and-parent-conferences), voice calls, file sharing)

## Useful tips

We recommend the following tips for messaging with students:

- Upload a profile picture so students can better connectwith the teacher and each other
- Create private Slack channels or spaces on Webex Teams for each of your classes. This keeps classroom discussions in that channel/space.
- Set your status to let others know if you are available,in a class,or offline
- In Slack, pin or star content to easilyfind it at a later time
- In Webex Teams, flagimportantcontent

## Free Messaging Tools
