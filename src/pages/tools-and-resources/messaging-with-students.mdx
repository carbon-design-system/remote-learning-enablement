Over the last few years, more and more businesses have begun to compliment existing communications channels, such as email, with messaging platforms that better support topic-based, real-time group messaging collaboration.

At IBM, our teams rapidly communicate throughout the day via tools like Slack and Webex Teams.

These tools can also benefit teachers and students moving from in-class to remote-learning environments, helping everyone stay informed and connected.

## How Can They Help Your Classroom?

Modern messaging platforms, like [Slack](https://slack.com/pricing/free) and [Cisco Webex Teams](https://www.webex.com/pricing/index.html), can hep your remote classroom similar to how they support our remote & globally-distributed teams at IBM. For example:

- Chat with your entire class together, with small groups, or individually
- Easily share information broadly, answer questions, and converse with students
- Answer students' questions immediately or at your next availability
- Easily share files and resources with your class
- Open conversations allow students to support each other when you're not available
- Allows for multiple, topic-based conversations within a single class
- You can post questions or poll students to quickly assess current knowledge or collect feedback
- Provides greater alignment with the way that students converse digitally than email
- Emoji reactions allow for quick responses while also engaging students
- These tools integrate with other collaboration solutions (e.g., [video conferencing](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/pmc-distance-learning-enablemet/tools-and-resources/classroom-and-parent-conferences), voice calls, file sharing)

## Tips and Tricks

Here are some tips and tricks we'd recommend for messaging with your students

- Upload a profile picture so students can better connect with you. Encourage your students to do the same!
- Create private Slack channels or spaces on Webex Teams for each of your classes. This keeps classroom discussions in that channel/space.
- Set your status to let others know if you are available, teaching a class, or offline.
- Engage students and introduce an element of fun by posting questions and polling students
- Pin (Slack) content for your class to easily find it at a later time.
- Star (Slack) or flag (Webex Teams) content for yourself.

## Free Messaging Tools

Ready to incorporate a messaging tool into your new remote learning classrooms? The following popular tools are offered for free to classrooms who have moved to remote learning to help slow the Covid-19 virus.

Slack offers a free plan that provides everything you'll need for messaging with your students, including unlimited messaging channels, ability to share files, and 1:1 voice & video calls.

Webex Teams offers unlimited messaging for free. To help make the transition to distance learning, Cisco has created [resources, training and how to guides](https://www.webex.com/content/dam/webex/eopi/assets/education/EducationK12TeacherWebexTeamsQSG.pdf#) that we hope will help support  IT, educators, staff and students as they make this transition.
