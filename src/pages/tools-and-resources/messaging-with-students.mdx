## How messaging platforms can help your classroom

Messaging platforms like [Cisco Webex Teams](https://www.webex.com/pricing/index.html) can help remote classroomsâ€”similar to how they support remote and globally distributed teams at IBM.

Messaging platforms enable students and teachers to:

<ul>
<li>Chat, share information and answer questions with the entire class, small groups or individually</li>
<li>Share files and resources with the class</li>
<li>Hold multiple, topic-based conversations within a single class</li>
<li>Better align with the way students already converse digitally</li>
<li>Use emoji reactions for quick responses and engagement</li>
</ul>

These tools also integrate with other collaboration solutions (e.g., video conferencing, voice calls, file sharing).
