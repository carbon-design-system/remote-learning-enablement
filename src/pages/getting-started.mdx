## Easier than you think

If you have concerns about how complicated or technical this will be, relax. Most of the basic tools you need to get started with remote connectivity and collaboration are pretty simple and all are intended to be used without having to read a manual or performing some complex set up. Most are really no more complicated than using a web browser or simple apps on your smart phone (in fact, some are available as apps for your phone or tablet).

Many students will already be comfortable with video conferencing, having used social media, though it may take some adjustment to use in an educational setting.

## Required and helpful approaches

There are a few things teachers and students will need to get started:

- A computer, tablet or smartphone - a computer will be the most flexible, but any of these devices can be effective.
- An internet connection (faster is better, but there are workarounds for slower connections we will cover in the Tips & Tricks section).
- While not always necessary, an account with the video conferencing software will be helpful (especially for teachers). The software is free, at least during the crisis, but an registering for a free account may provide additional capabilities (e.g., recording sessions).

Helpful, but **not** required:

- A quiet area in your home – even better if you can point the webcam in a direction where you and a static background are the only things visible.
- A microphone or headset – try your computer's built in mic and speakers, in many case they are perfectly fine but a headset can help if you don't have a quiet area.
