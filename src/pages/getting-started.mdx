Most of the basic tools you need to get started with remote connectivity and collaboration are simple and are intended to be used without the need of a manual or a complex set up.

## Helpful approaches

A few things teachers and students will need:

- A computer, tablet, or smartphone. A computer will be the most flexible, but any of these devices can work
- An internet connection (faster is better, but there are options for slower connections in the Useful Tips section)
- While not always necessary, an account with the video conferencing software will be helpful, especially for teachers. The software is free, at least during the crisis, but registering for a free account may provide additional capabilities, such as recording sessions

## Helpful resources

While not required, the following resources can assist in creating a productive environment: 

- A quiet area in your home. Place the webcam in a direction where you and a static background are the only things visible
- A microphone or headset. Try your computer's built in mic and speakersâ€”in many cases, they are fine, but a headset can help if you don't have a quiet area
