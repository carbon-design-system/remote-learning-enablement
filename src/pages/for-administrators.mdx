## You've got this.

<PageDescription>

COVID-19 has created some unprecedented situations, a great deal of concern, and unique challenges. As an administrator, the staff, parents, and community are looking to you for guidance. We know that recent weeks haven't been easy.

Just remember if any job can prepare you for unique challenges and community demands, being a school administrator is one of them. You eat crises for breakfast; and that's after solving several before breakfast. Though these are unique times with unique challenges, many of your existing problem-solving approaches (e.g., collecting data, driving consensus) will serve you well here. Your staff and community want your leadership and there are many resources (like this one) to support you.

## Why have a strategy for remote learning?

It's easy to try to solve remote learning challenges piecemeal ("I have problem X, I'll grab solution Y"). In the long run, though, this might generate problems that you could have avoided. Here's why you may want a comprehensive, thought-out plan for how you'll do remote learning.

### Conflicting tools

You have a motivated staff who will try to solve problems themselves if you don't provide direction. This can lead to different teachers choosing different solutions, sometimes for the same purpose. Long term, this will be a challenge for your parents/guardians (and therefore you).

### Group enablement

Rolling out technology to a new group of users can be challenging. Managing IDs/passwords, communicating about the new tool, providing education, etc. all need to be considered. By having a plan for what technology will be used across a large group of people, you can be more efficient and reuse assets.

### Avoiding pitfalls

In evaluating tools at a school- or district-level you may head off longer-term problems. For example, a solution that works for one classroom may not scale when a larger audience is required. By looking at a broader level, you can ensure the solutions meet your long-term requirements.

### Setting up references and resources

Though virtually all tools have existing support (e.g., help sites, videos) which you can rely on, you will have some role in supporting the solutions. This can range from maintaining a list of helpful links to having staff members who can provide some basic support. Fewer tools will mean less support needed.

## Creating a remote learning strategy

So, you are convinced. Now what?

## Deciding what you need

Your specific needs will drive what technology you secure. Below we provide a list of possible capabilities to consider with links to examples.

| School situation | Capability | Type of technology |
| -- | -- | -- |
|Virtual Classrooms and Parent Conferences|A smaller group interacting with a leader|[Video conferencing]()|
|School Assembly|Address a large group with limited interaction|[Video streaming (also enables on-demand viewing of topics)]() |
|Getting extra help from a teacher|Direct messaging; one-on-one or small group|[Instant messaging, group chats, email, phone]() |
|Assigning and collecting homework|Exchanging, commenting on, sharing materials|[Document sharing]()|

### Existing tools

The list above might seem daunting. Most likely, however, you already have some solutions in place. Some of your existing tools may have features that you haven't used before. Your staff may be able to give you feedback about tools they have been using to help guide your decisions.

If you aren't already aware of the tools used by your staff and all their capabilities, you may want to poll your staff about their tool usage. You can also poll parents/guardians and students.

### Parents / guardians survey

In preparing how you'll approach remote learning, having an understanding of the technical capabilities, technical comfort, and preferences of your community. You may already know this, but if not it is worth asking some basics (e.g., don't assume all your community have systems / broadband). There are several online survey tools that could help you.

## Evaluating tools

Once you know what capabilities you require in your remote learning and what tools you are already using, you can begin the process of choosing one tool per capability. To do so, you may want to:

  - Determine requirements for each tool (e.g., a broadcast solution might not support the number of viewers that your district requires). Be sure to think about who will be using the tools (e.g., ensure accessibility).
  - Create a table for how well each solution meets your requirements.
  - Personally try out the tools (a step skipped more often than you might think)
  - Test the solutions. For example, if you are selecting a video conferencing solution, have an actual teacher give an actual lecture to actual students (a test group). Nothing equals this for raising requirements you haven't considered or uncovering issues and it can be done fairly quickly.

### Train your staff

Once you have selected a solution, invest in making sure your staff understands its use. Provide lists of assets (e.g., videos on how to use) and sessions where your staff can try it out before being live with students. Remember, when parents and students run into problems, they will probably go to the teachers first for help. It is therefore wise to invest in making sure your teachers are comfortable with the new technology.

### Tool rollout

Recommending a tool to new users can go more smoothly with a little planning. Things to consider:

  - Be positive - but don't oversell.
  - Address chief concerns (will this affect our students' grades?)
  - Have support ready.
  - You can do a test rollout with a small group - but don't release "in waves" - parents talk and miscommunication occurs.
  - See if the tech company will help.
