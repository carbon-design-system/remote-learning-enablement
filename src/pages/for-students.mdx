## Let the learning begin!

<PageDescription>

Like most High School students, you are probably expecting your school to be closed for the next several weeks.  We are fortunate that many schools will be offering online learning activities, using technology to help you continue your education while at home.  Hopefully, you will be able to complete your school year on time!

Not all schools are the same, and not all schools use the same technology.  So, the following is intended to help you prepare for attending virtual classes using video conferencing, but always refer to the information from your school for specific steps to follow and technology to use.

## What can you expect?

  - The audio and video in a video conference can sometimes get choppy.  You may have experienced this from time to time if you have used FaceTime or Google Hangouts. Unfortunately, you may have to ask your family to not stream video (Netflix, YouTube, etc.) or audio (Spotify, etc.) if you experience these problems when in your video conference.
  - Your school may be using an app or website that you have not used before.  If there is a "test meeting", join it to make sure you can connect and are familiar with how to use it.
  - Some tools immediately start broadcasting your audio and video, so BE PREPARED!
  - Many apps continue to broadcast your video even if you switch to a different app... don't assume no one can see you just because you do not see them.
  - Understand that everyone is dealing with this unusual and stressful situation, and not everyone handles it the same.  Some of your classmates may appear more anxious than normal, while others may be joking about the situation.  Try to be patient with your classmates and teachers.

## Be prepared for video conferencing

  - Check out the video app training.
  - Download the video conference app and test it out. (create an account, make sure your login works). 
  - Do a test run with a fellow student.
  - Try to follow your normal sleep schedule.
  - Dress for school - don't show up in your pajamas (well, at least not a pajama top).
  - Join on time!
  - Write up your class schedule with your parents and keep it where everyone can see.
  - Make it fun - create your own "Class in Session" sign so no one in your home can bother you during class.
  - Talk to your parent about a quiet place where you can have "class time." And be mindful that others can see what's in the background. 

  - Pull up the assignment on (box, schoology, Office 365, Google Docs) before class so you are prepared

## During video conferencing

  - If you leave your camera off, your teacher and friends may think you are not paying attention.
  - Troubleshooting technical issues? Be proactive, and test the video conferencing app before class.
  - Make sure your school records the sessions and easy access in case you miss something or your system shuts down
  - Keep a phone nearby in case your web connection fails and you can dial in -No Insta or Tik Tok!
  - Use headphones or earbuds so you can hear without disruption.
  - If you are going to share your assignment, have it ready for when it's your turn.
  - Introduce/announce yourself when you join, especially if others may not see you join.
  - Go on mute when you're not speaking.
  - "Raise your hand" - many tools have a button to indicate you have a question.
  - When asking a question, there may be a longer delay than normal, so don't feel like you have to quickly repeat the question ("Did you hear me?  I asked if...").
  - Use group chat, if available, to ask questions or "talk" with your classmates and teacher.  This helps avoid everyone talking at once and is less likely to be delayed like the audio and video.

## General distance learning best practices

  - Have a positive attitude and be motivated
  - When you run into a challenge, keep trying and ask for help
  - Review the syllabus for each of your courses. plan and ensure you have enough time to study and complete your assignments
  - Make a daily "To Do" list.
  - Set up a dedicated and comfortable study place: good lighting and ergonomically friendly seating.  
  - You may want to just sit in bed, but try to sit at a desk or table so you can place your computer, tablet, etc. om a flat surface.  Otherwise you may appear to "bounce" as your camera moves around.
  - Be focused! Just like at school, you should avoid being distracted by games, the internet, your phone, etc when it is time to participate in class.
  - Establish a daily routine.
  - Break down big projects into small, manageable parts.  Don't drag your feet; make yourself do things on time.
  - Limit your time online
  - Learn to deal with setbacks and persists through challenges.

  - Seek help when needed.

  - Learn to communicate through email and online
