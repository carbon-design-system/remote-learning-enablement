As schools pivot to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, many parents and guardians find themselves having to create a learning environment for their children at home. As a first step, it’s important to follow the direction from your child’s school on technology, online instruction and other critical services that your school system provides.

## How to prepare for remote learning

**Technology**

- Your school may already be using online tools for learning. If not, they will likely specify the software your child will use for remote learning.
- If your school is using web conferencing software, the good news is that it can be accessed on a variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets and phones.
   - Depending on your web connection, it may be advisable to turn off video at times when bandwidth becomes low.
   - Your child can use a photo of him or herself (an avatar), so that other students and the teacher can easily identify your child.
   - Have your child sign-in to learning activities a few minutes ahead of time to minimize software setup and maximize class participation.

**Environment**

- Establish a quiet learning space in your home for your child to learn without disruption.
- If your child has independent assignments, try to adhere to a consistent schedule with learning activities planned throughout your child’s day.
- Stay in communication with your child’s teachers.
   - If possible, schedule time with your child’s teacher on a regular basis to track progress.
   - Contact teachers when you do not understand what is being asked of your child.
   - Encourage your child to get up, move around, and take breaks.

Remember, it’s going to be messy (at least at first), but you and your children will get through it!
