## Getting started

Understand what your school is doing for remote learning. This takes many forms, so first understand what your options are, then work to install the proper software to enable your children to be successful. Communicate with your teachers and your children. Be aware of what the work is and when assignments are due.

## How to prepare your children for remote learning

- Establish a quiet "learning space" in your home for your child to participate in learning activities
- Be mindful of what's going on behind your child so as to avoid disrupting learning activities
- Know what software will be used for learning activities and ensure that your child has the requisite user account credentials necessary to participate:
  - Web conferencing (WebEx)
  - Messaging (Slack, WebEx Teams)
- Most web conferencing software can be used on a multitude of hardware: Desktop, Laptop, Tablet, Phone
  - Depending on your web connection it may be advisable to turn off video at times as bandwidth becomes low to remain engaged and connected
  - In low-bandwidth situations we also suggest that your child leverage a photo of themselves (often referred to as an "avatar") so that other students and the teacher can easily identify your child
- Try to adhere to a consistent schedule with learning activities scheduled throughout your child's day
- Ongoing communication and engagement with teachers and other students is critical and helps establish a sense of normalcy
- Have your child sign in to learning activities a few minutes ahead of time to minimize software setup and to maximize class participation
- Stay in communication with your child's teachers:
  - Schedule time with teachers weekly to track your child's progress and to identify areas of additional growth or interest to your child
  - Reach out to teachers when you do not understand what is being asked of your children
- Remember to encourage your child to get up, move around and take breaks often

## k-4 students

- Be there with your child, especially when they first begin engaging in learning activities
- Check in on your child regularly to ensure they remain engaged in learning activities
- Encourage your child to actively engage in class learning activities as they would in-person
  - Ensure your child is prepared to ask questions via audio or in the class chat
  - Encourage your child to engage in group activities

## 5-8 students

- Help keep your child engaged in learning activities
- Understand what the assignments are and when they are due
- Be sure your child stays up to date and works on their school work everyday. Do not let them procrastinate and try to do it all at once at the last minute.
- It is OK for your child to have some fun and chat with other students, but also be sure they focus and have real time for school work as well. This is not vacation.

## 9-12 students

- Be sure your child has access to their assignments and materials
- Be sure your child is doing work every day and not procrastinating
- Understand what assignments your child has and when they are due so you can help them stay on schedule
