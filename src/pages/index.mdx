## Technology to help teachers, students and parents

On any given day, over 200K IBMers around the globe are working together to run the world's most critical infrastructure. As we collectively navigate the current crisis, we want to share our expertise and help educators and children continue their learning.

Each of us is facing new challenges in how we work and live, and we understand that many teachers and students will need to adapt to overcome these challenges. Though business and educational contexts differ on many dimensions, we believe we can provide some guidance in navigating some of the challenges students and teachers will encounter during this period.

>     IBM has made strategic investments to modernize our infrastructure, applications, ways of working/tooling, and remote work etiquette; on any given day hundreds of thousands of IBMers are successfully working remotely around the globe. Weâ€™ve learned a lot, and would like to share it with you

## Why IBM?

IBM has heavily invested and modernized its infrastructure, applications, and ways of working to support a globally distributed workforce. We have learned through experience and experimentation how best to equip our people with collaboration tools and techniques to ensure that so that remote workers are not disadvantaged. Many of the lessons we have learned and techniques we have mastered can help you to achieve the most engaging and effective environment possible short of being in the same room together.

Some of what we have to share is about technology - how teachers and students can actually connect with each other - but others are about people - their needs, concerns and behavior. We have spent years delivering global video conferencing capabilities to all IBMers around the globe, and invested in training how to have effective virtual meetings - for example, we have invested in training employees to understand body language on video conferences, and that more than half of communication is visual not verbal.

We know that being physically or geographically separated from each other presents a different set of challenges than are faced in a traditional classroom - from privacy to social etiquette while on a video conference. How do you deal with background noise? How does a student indicate that they want to speak or ask a question? How do you use online chat capabilities as part of the experience?

These pages will provide our best practices and recommendations for getting the most out of interacting remotely - whether a teacher is connecting with a class and sharing lecture materials or a school-wide assembly is being held virtually.

We believe that beyond attending to the educational needs of students, there is value in connecting "face to face" even when that connection is virtual. We have seen the impact of this technology on remote teams that develop a greater sense of engagement and psychological safety and we believe this approach will help ease the fears and stresses impacting students, teachers and parents today.
