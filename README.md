## About

Every day, hundreds of thousands of IBMers globally are working together to run the world's most critical infrastructure. As we navigate the current crisis, we want to share our expertise to help educators and children continue their learning.
This site offers guidance for some of the challenges students and teachers will encounter during this period.

## Why IBM?

We have spent years delivering global video conferencing capabilities to all IBMers globally and invested in training how to have effective virtual meetings, ensuring that remote workers are successful.

Being physically or geographically separated from each other presents a different set of challenges than when in a traditional classroom, such as background noise, asking questions, and using onlinechat. These pages will provide our best practices and recommendations for getting the most out of interacting remotely.

There is value in connecting with one another, even when the connection is virtual. We have seen teams develop a greater sense of engagement and psychological safety. We believe this approach will help ease the fears and stresses impacting students, teachers, and parents during this time.
